# Sketch2Art

Sketch2Art is an innovative application that transforms your simple sketches into stunning art pieces using advanced machine learning algorithms. It's designed for artists, designers, and anyone who loves to create.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up Sketch2Art on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher

   cd Sketch2Art
   ```

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

   Isolate your project by creating a virtual environment:
