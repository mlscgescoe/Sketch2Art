# Hacktoberfest Contribution: Sketch to Realistic Image Converter

## Project Overview

The Sketch to Realistic Image Converter is an exciting project that transforms hand-drawn sketches into realistic images. We're looking to improve this project by replacing the current API integration with a custom AI/ML model and enhancing the user interface. This project is perfect for beginners looking to dive into AI/ML and web development!

## Main Objectives

1. Replace API Integration with AI/ML Model
2. Improve User Interface
3. Enhance Overall User Experience

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Replace API Integration with AI/ML Model

**Current Status:** The project uses an external API for image generation.

**Goal:** Develop and integrate a custom AI/ML model to replace the API.

**Steps:**
- Research and choose an appropriate machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
- Collect and prepare a dataset of sketch-image pairs for training.
- Develop a model architecture suitable for image-to-image translation (e.g., pix2pix GAN, U-Net).
- Train the model on the prepared dataset.
- Integrate the trained model into the existing Python backend.
- Modify `helpers.py` to use the new model instead of API calls.

**Beginner-Friendly Tips:**
- Start with a simple model architecture and gradually improve it.
- Use pre-trained models and transfer learning to speed up development.
- Utilize online resources and tutorials for guidance on image-to-image translation tasks.

### 2. Improve User Interface

**Current Status:** The UI is built with Streamlit, which is great for prototyping but limited in customization.

**Goal:** Create a more interactive and visually appealing frontend.

**Steps:**
- Convert the frontend to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Implement a responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Create a modern, intuitive interface for sketch input and image display.
- Add real-time preview of the sketch as it's being drawn.
- Implement drag-and-drop functionality for image upload.

**Beginner-Friendly Tips:**
- Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Tailwind for easier styling.
- Consider using a JavaScript library like React or Vue.js for more interactive components.
- Start with a simple design and incrementally add features.

### 3. Enhance Overall User Experience

**Goal:** Make the application more user-friendly and feature-rich.

**Steps:**
- Add a gallery of example sketches and their generated images.
- Implement user accounts to save and share generated images.
- Create a tutorial or walkthrough for first-time users.
- Add options to adjust generation parameters (e.g., style, intensity).
- Implement undo/redo functionality in the sketch canvas.

**Beginner-Friendly Tips:**
- Focus on one feature at a time.
- Use localStorage or a simple database like SQLite for user data storage.
- Gather feedback from users to prioritize the most impactful features.
